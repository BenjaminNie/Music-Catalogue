Music-Catalogue
===============

Music catalogue consisting of genres, subgenres, and albums.  Genres are stored into containers found in the music catalogue, and each genre is capable of having one or more subgenres. (ex. genre = rock, sub-genre = 90s rock).  Genres contain albums, which are defined by their artist, title, and song list.  The albums are also queryable, using logical statements such as AND and OR.  The user can specify various attributes they are searching for (ex. Genre = rock, artist = Kid Rock) and have matching results returned to them.
